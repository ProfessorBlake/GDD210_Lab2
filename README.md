# GDD210 - Lab2
 
Lab two is designed to familiarize you with Unity's physics systems.

## Scene 1

In scene 1 you will find a ball with RigidBody2D and CircleCollider components, and a scene with BoxCollider components. These are the basic building blocks for a physics simulation in Unity.

## Scene 2
Scene 2 features several PhysicsMaterial2D assets, which can give you control of a physics object's bounciness and friction.

## Scene 3
Scene 3 introduces us to a function which adds force to a RigidBody, AddForce(). It also explains the difference between a MonoBehaviours Update and FixedUpdate functions.
